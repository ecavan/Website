I believe in being a well rounded person- I have many interests outside of mathematics such as literature, philosophy and politics for example. 

I've had many mentors and heroes along my journey, whether that be great professors from the universities I've attended (Roger Melko, A. Kempf, E. Martiniez and R.B Mann, to name but a few), actors (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Williams), comics (Bill Hicks, George Carlin), musicians (Kurt Cobain, Jerry Garcia, John Fogerty) great writers (Charles Bukowski, Philip Roth, Oscar Wilde) and great scientists (Richard Feynman, Leonard Susskind, Albert Einstein). I am also grateful for the influence of great women such as Margaret Atwood, Emmy Noether, Vera Rubin, Ursula Le Guin and my Msc supervisor Cristina Stoica.  

I hope to one day live up to the memory of these great men and women.
